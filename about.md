Hi, I'm Alex. I'm a software engineer with an affinity for AI, ML, and computer vision. I studied at the University of British Columbia and am currently working for Boeing in Mountain View, California.

I will be making occasional posts in this blog about topics I find interesting within the field of AI. As a visual learner I hope to enable others like myself with the ability to see, first-hand, what modern AI is capable of. 

Most of my posts will include an in-browser demo using TensorflowJS and a relevant implementation in Python on my GitHub. 

__If live demos do not load, please try with Chrome or Firefox and update your browser to the latest version.__
